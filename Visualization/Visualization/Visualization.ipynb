    "Make sure to **read the instructions** completely. Failing to follow the instructions will have a negative impact on your grade!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore ways to visualize the data, starting with simple plots for early exploration and build towards more interactive methods. As we want to go beyond static plots possible with for example matplotlib or seaborn, we will use the [Bokeh](https://www.bokeh.org/) library. This means the exercises **must** be implemented with Bokeh to receive points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment includes four parts (Assignmets V.1 to V.4) which provide different amounts of points. V.1 to V.3 are independent assignments, but V.4 builds on the previous assignments.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Before you submit**, make sure that you are not accidentaly using any global variables. Restart the kernel (wiping all global variables) and run the code from top to bottom by clicking \"Kernel\" => \"Restart & Run all\" in the menu bar at the top.\n",

    "### Rules\n",
    "For this assignment the following rules apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "**General**\n",
    " * The assignment should be completed in the **groups** you have already assembled for the previous assignment. Work together on all parts and do not distribute the work. Everyone is responsible for everything. That also means if there is fraud in a part it will be considered fraud by the whole group and voids the complete assignment, even if you distributed the parts of the assignment.\n",
    " * Any kind of intergroup discussion will be considered fraud and both the parties will be punished.\n",
    " * All code must be written within group. All external help, with the exception of Python/library documentation and the lecture slides, will be considered fraud.\n",
    " * Do not add any libarires to those already included notebook (i.e., `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, and `bokeh`)\n",
    " * Add functionality from bokeh, like ```from bokeh.io import output_notebook```, on top of the block where you need it.\n",
    " * **Do not rename the notebook file**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading**\n",
    " * Exercise may (partially) be graded automatically, using additional hidden tests. These tests will check your solution for different (unseen) inputs.\n",
    " * If these tests pass without error (warnings are allowed) then you receive full points.\n",
    " * Do not make any assumptions on the input data (such as number or type of columns) unless specified otherwise. Doing so may result in the tests failing and thus 0 points.\n",
    " * Your grade is calculated as the sum of the achieved points and will be rounded to the closest 0.1 point.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Submissions**\n",
    " * Submit your code to Brightspace\n",
    " * For this assignment you must *only* submit the notebook (`*.ipynb`) file filled in with your solution.\n",
    " * Refer to Brightspace for the exact deadline.\n",
    " * We will consider submissions that are handed in up to 3 hourse after the deadline but with a penalty as follows:\n",
    " * For every completed 20 minutes past the deadline the grade will be reduced by 0.5 (e.g., with the deadline at 17:00, a submission at 17:19 will get the full grade, a submission at 17:20 will receive a 0.5 grade penalty."
